OK.
So I've got two branches now:-
- Development
- Version01a

I've also got three potentially confusing Version controls bits: -
- Github website
- Guthub desktop
- Pycharm VCS

I think it is less confusing if I don't use PyCharm VCS.
It's probably also better to work directly from the local Github repo.

In other words openPyCharm directly on the local Github repo.
This way any changes made are already reflected in the Github desktop.

When I've finished working for the day I must make a pull request from the Github desktop.
I should then go to Github website to commit the pull request.

This will mean that at the end of the day. The Github website has the latest changes.

Start work
----------
Make sure I've downloaded the development branch from  the website to the desktop.

Work
----
Work directly in the local github repo. Open with PyCharm from that location.

End Work
--------
In Github desktop make a pull request to update the webbased development branch with the latest changes.


--------
Still not got it.
--------
I make changes in PyCharm but these changes are not reflected in Desktop until I do VCS Add.
The file is in red until I VSC Add.
Then the file changes to green.
Now PyCharm and desktop are in Sync.
However Desktop and Web are not the same.
I can't do a commit from Development to Development because Desktop says they are the same.
I can only do a commit to another branch, i.e. Version01a but I don't want to do that.
Version 01a is a backup copy and should not be changed.

I may have got it.
------------------
Make changes on PyCharm.
Look on Desktop (Left hand side).
It shows there are changes.
Do a local commit.
Do a Sync.
Then the local repo and the remote repo are the same.

This is it
----------
Change in PyCharm.
Commit and Sync in Desktop.
Everything is tickety boo.
