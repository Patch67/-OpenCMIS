Notes
-----
After I downloaded the development site from github it would not run giving lots of errors.
It would not run make migrations either.

It turns out that all the migrations folders need deleting.
This is because I am using sqlite3 and I have transferred this with the rest of the source code.
So it doesn't need any migrations it already works.
The migrations were what was left over form operations on another computer with different versions.

Delete all the migrations folders and all worked well.

I don't know if this would work for Postgresql


Notes 2
-------
git status shows loads of *.pyc (Python cache files) as changed.
There is no need to commit these changes.
Use git add to add a new file if you want.
Then git commit to register changes that you want in the repo (not *.pyc files).
git push will only push the files you have committed.
